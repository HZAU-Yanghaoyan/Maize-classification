This project focuses on maize image classification using deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The workflow includes: Training CNN models to classify maize images under different environments. Evaluating model performance using multiple metrics. Extracting deep phenotypes from the trained models to distinguish maize responses to different environments.
